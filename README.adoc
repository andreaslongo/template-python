The best way to get started is to build and run a local dev container.

You can use https://podman.io[Podman] or any other OCI compliant container manager.
The dev container has all the required dependencies for working with the project.

[,console]
----
$ container/build.sh
$ container/run.sh
----

From inside the container, you can then run some workflows.

[,console]
----
$ pipx run nox -s dev   # Create a dev virtual-env
$ pipx run nox -s test  # run tests
$ pipx run nox -s lint  # run linters
