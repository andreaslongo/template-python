== Getting started

== Contributing

The best way to get started is to build and run a local dev container.

You can use https://podman.io[Podman] or any other OCI compliant container manager.
The dev container has all the required dependencies for working with the project.

[source, bash]
----
container/build.sh
container/run.sh
----

From inside the container, you can then run some workflows.

[source, bash]
----
pipx run nox -s dev   # Create a dev venv
pipx run nox -s test  # run tests
pipx run nox -s lint  # run linters
