If you have the Podman container manager available, the best way to get started is to build and start a local dev container.

----
container/build.sh
container/run.sh
----

The dev container will have all the required dependencies available to get started.

Inside the container, use nox for your workflows.

----
nox (create dev venv)
nox test
nox lint
...
